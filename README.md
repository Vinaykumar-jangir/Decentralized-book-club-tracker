## Project Title
**Decentralized Book Club Tracker**

## Project Description
The **Decentralized Book Club Tracker** is a smart contract-based solution built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to manage their personal book library. It provides functionality for adding books, marking them as read, and tracking their progress. The decentralized nature ensures transparency and security for the users' data, as the information is stored on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to empower individuals to manage their reading journey securely and transparently. By leveraging blockchain technology, users can ensure that their book collection and reading progress are tamper-proof. Additionally, the project aims to create a decentralized community where users can share their reading habits and discover new books.

## Future Scope
- **Social Features:** Adding functionality for users to share their reading lists with others, join book clubs, and discuss books within the platform.
- **Book Recommendations:** Integrating a recommendation engine based on reading patterns and user preferences.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Utilizing decentralized storage solutions like IPFS for storing book information, providing even more robust decentralization.
- **Governance Features:** Introducing community governance to allow users to vote on improvements or changes to the contract.

## Key Features
- **Add Books:** Users can add books to their library with details such as title, author, genre, and year published.
- **Mark Books as Read:** Users can mark books as "read" once they complete them, allowing for progress tracking.
- **View Reading List:** Users can retrieve and view the books they have added, including their reading status.
- **Remove Books:** Users can remove books from their list if they no longer wish to track them.
- **Decentralized & Secure:** The user's data is securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring that the reading history remains immutable and transparent.
